author: Xplane
overview: |
    Organizations that thrive in changing circumstances behave more like organisms than machines. They adapt and evolve rather than reprogram and retool. They share a common DNA that helps them bend without breaking. XPLANE found eight specific traits that support a healthy, robust approach to change: clarity, inspiration, visual alignment, action, co-creation, transparency, harmony and resilience.
